## Assignment

We use assignment to 'store' data we might want to use later, and we give it a name to help us remember what the data was.

Here's an example:

```ruby
error_message_for_user = "Sorry, that failed. Please try again in 20 minutes."
```

In the assignment drills, you'll set up and assign basic instances of the following Ruby objects:

- Integers
- Floats
- `true` and `false`
- Symbols
- Strings
- Arrays
- Hashes

### Getting started

Run the drill with `ruby drill.rb` from the command-line.

> You have to get the indentation and spacing right to get the right answer.

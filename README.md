# Drills

Horribly boring drills that will reduce typing overhead when programming.

There's a leaderboard for the drills [here](https://calm-shore-15377.herokuapp.com/). Try them and see how you do!

## About

When we program, we're spending 99% of our headspace thinking about how to solve a problem. These drills aren't like that: there are no problems. They're like musical instrument scales: getting common syntax features under your fingers (or other input method) as quickly as possible, so you don't have to spend any brainpower thinking about how to write this function or make a class with that instance variable.

The trick here is repetitive, continuous practice, with a small incentive: to beat the timer.

The final section contains simple problems to solve. You should be able to dedicate 99% of your brain to thinking about them, and 1% to the actual code you're writing.

## Future

This would probably be a good exercise for learning the various functions in a given language's standard library. I'm gathering data about its effectiveness first.
